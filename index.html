			<div class="headlineDiv">The Battle Over Minimum Wage</div>
			
			
			
			<div class="textDiv"><p class="text">	On April 23, a Senate bill that would have raised the 
				federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour failed to clear a Republican filibuster. The debate 
				over whether to raise the federal minimum wage will most assuredly be at the center of the 
				fight for U.S. Congressional seats going into the 2014 mid-term elections. The issue is a 
				well-trodden battleground in American politics, with Democrats arguing that the nation's 
				lowest earners are in desperate need of economic relief, while Republicans warn that a 
				rise in the price floor for labor will hurt employment in the midst of a prolonged 
				period of slow job growth. The months leading up to November promise no shortage of 
				office seekers making vague references to economic studies that irrefutably prove the 
				righteousness of their position.  But the economists whose work serves as ammunition in 
				this theater of the political shooting war between conservative and progressive factions, 
				offer a more nuanced view over how an increase to the current minimum wage might affect the economy.</p>
				<p class="text">	Analysis of the minimum wage in the United States offers a range of 
					easily accessible, countable statistics. We know, for example, that for the past 23 years 
					the real value of the minimum wage has not risen above the lowest levels it saw between 
					1955 and 1981. We also know that more than half of minimum wage earners are under the age 
					of 25, and two thirds of them are women.</p>

			<div class="textDiv"><p class="text">The broader effects of changes to the minimum wage,
				 however, are harder to pinpoint. Isolating situations where differences in local 
				 minimum wages aren't accompanied by other, potentially confounding economic 
				 differences is a difficult task. Further complicating matters is the fact that 
				 economists seem unable to reach a consensus on how potential effects of a wage floor 
				 might manifest in a broader economy. While most Americans are familiar with the use of 
				 unemployment rates as a convenient barometer for overall economic health. However, job 
				 growth, consumer spending and employment turnover rates are also potentially telling 
				 economic indicators that economists argue may be more directly affected by raises to 
				 the minimum wage.

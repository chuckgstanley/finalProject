<div class="textDiv"><p class="text">It can't help that adding new research to the existing literature about this topic is akin to volunteering
for a level of public criticism, second-guessing and skepticism, from enlightened amateurs, that few economists ever get to experience.</p>

<div class="textDiv"><p class="text">"I normally work on far less controvercial issues like charitable giving," says Jonathan Meer, an assistant professor of economics at Texas A&M who co-authored
a study last year on the negative impact of high minimum wages on employment growth. He says intense feelings about the minimum wage as a political issue make
it a delicate topic of study, adding, "The economics have really gotten mixed up with the politics."</p>

<div class="textDiv"><p class="text">Daniel Aarinson, vice president and director of microeconomic research at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago sums up the atmosphere surrounding minimum 
wage studies even more concisely. "This is a hornet's nest," he says.</p>

<div class="textDiv"><p class="text">Taken alone, Aarinson and Meer's recent studies seem to tell starkly divergent stories about the potential fallout of a hike to the minimum wage.
Aarinson helped conduct a study, last year, that showed significant increases in spending by low-wage workers in the months following a jump in 
local minimum wages without any significant accompanying change in unemployment levels. The boost in spending was far greater than the value added to
low-wage paychecks higher minimum wage.</p> 

<div class="textDiv"><p class="text">Meer, on the other hand, co-authored a study which found that job growth in economies with a higher minimum wage tended to be slower than in comperable
areas with a lower minimum wage. Meer found that people didn't lose jobs as a direct result of the higher minimum wage, but once jobs were vacated,
businesses were less likely to try and fill them.</p> 	

<div class="textDiv"><p class="text">"It's not that people are getting fired," says Meer. "Its that people may not ever get hired in the first place."</p>

<div class="textDiv"><p class="text">So which is it? Does a higher minimum wage inject more money into economies, by putting cash in the hands of people who are likely to spend it 
right away? Or does government meddling in the job market deter businesses from hiring?</p>

<div class="textDiv"><p class="text">The answer, it turns out, is a little more complicated than that. While Meer and Aarinson's studies both looked at raises for minimum wage workers,
the beneficiaries of those raises were very different.</p>

<div class="textDiv"><p class="text">Those most effected by the lack of job growth found in Meer's study fell roughly in line with the age demographics of minimum wage earners
nationally, disproportionately represented by workers between the ages of 18 and 25. About one in six, he says were heads of households. Meer 
describes these workers as the sort of people, who could benefit from low-wage work and the opportunity to move up the ladder.</p>

<div class="textDiv"><p class="text">Aarinson's work, on the other hand, looked specifically at adults, aiming to establish spending habits for families that depend on at least
one minimum wage income for basic expenses. Even within that group, the outsized spending increases brought on by
the boost in minimum wage was localized in a very small number of households. Aarinson says that the spending increases he saw in his study were 
almost entirely due to purchases of new cars in the months following the wage increase. </p>

<div class="textDiv"><p class="text">"It's a very small fraction of households, but the amount they are spending on these cars is very high."</p>

<div class="textDiv"><p class="text">Aarinson says that new car purchases have a huge multiplyer effect in local economies, because only a fraction of the cost is paid up front. 
Families who purchased a new car, he says, generally relied on a minimum wage job as a supplementary income and used the extra money from the higher
minimum wage to move up the replacement of an older, less reliable car. He also stresses that after the initial provided by a jump in the minimum wage,
he would expect the trend to correct itself, as families that made a major investment in a new car struggle to manage the additional debt brought
on through the purpose.</p>

<div class="textDiv"><p class="text">"Any time you have an effect like this, it's temporary," says Aarinson. "It's a short-term stimulative effect 
over the first year or so."</p>

<div class="textDiv"><p class="text">Both Meer and Aarinson come back to the term, "trade-off," as they talk about how their findings might inform the policy debate over whether 
to raise the federal minimum wage. At it's current level, they agree, a modest increase in the federal minimum wage is not likely to send
unemployment levels skyrocketing, nor will it bathe the country's lowest earners in newfound prosperity.</p> 

<div class="textDiv"><p class="text">"We could have full employment tomorrow if we decided to ban all farm equipment," 
says Meer,  who says the debate over the minimum wage has been oversimplified, on both sides, 
to the point that it's now a sort of holy war. "Reasonable people can disagree on the trade-offs."</p>
